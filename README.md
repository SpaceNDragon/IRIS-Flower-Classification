# IRIS-Flower-Classification

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You have selected a text snippet from a notebook that introduces you to the basics of machine learning using the Iris dataset. This dataset contains information about the sepal and petal measurements of three different species of iris flowers. ðŸŒ¸

In this notebook, you will learn how to:

Load and explore the dataset using Python Visualize the data using histograms, scatter plots, pair plots Train and test various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, and KNN Compare the accuracy of different models using petals and sepals separately Make predictions for new observations using the best model This notebook is a great way to get started with machine learning and understand some of the key concepts and techniques. You will also get to practice your coding skills in Python, popular languages for data analysis and visualization. ðŸ’»

I hope you find this notebook useful and interesting. If you do, please upvote it and share it with your friends. ðŸ˜Š

And if you want to see something more creative and fun, how about I try to create a graphic art of an iris flower for you? ðŸŽ¨

Iâ€™ll try to create that.
